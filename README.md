# Airbnb Clone Project

## Team Roles

### 1. Backend Developer
Responsible for designing, building, and maintaining the server-side logic of the application. Implements API endpoints, handles authentication, and integrates with databases and external services.

### 2. Frontend Developer
Builds the user interface and ensures a smooth user experience using frameworks like React or Vue.js. Collaborates closely with backend developers to consume APIs and render data on the client side.

### 3. Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs and manages the database schema, ensures data integrity, optimizes performance, and implements backups and recovery strategies.

### 4. DevOps Engineer
Manages infrastructure, automates deployments using CI/CD pipelines, monitors application performance, and ensures system reliability.

### 5. Project Manager
Coordinates the team, manages timelines and deliverables, communicates with stakeholders, and ensures the project stays on track and within scope.

### 6. QA Engineer
Develops and runs tests to ensure that features are bug-free and meet the requirements. Automates test scripts and handles manual testing for critical flows.

## Technology Stack

### Django
A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend, RESTful APIs, and handle authentication and business logic.

### PostgreSQL
A powerful open-source relational database system used to store and manage application data such as users, bookings, and property details.

### GraphQL
An API query language used for more flexible and efficient data retrieval between the client and server.

### Docker
Used for containerizing the application to ensure consistent environments across development, testing, and production.

### GitHub Actions
A CI/CD tool used to automate testing, building, and deploying the application.

### React (or similar frontend framework)
Handles the client-side UI, making the application interactive and user-friendly.

## Database Design

### 1. Users
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `username`: Unique login name
- `email`: Contact email address
- `password_hash`: Encrypted user password
- `role`: (e.g., host, guest)

### 2. Properties
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `title`: Name of the listing
- `description`: Description of the property
- `location`: Address or coordinates
- `owner_id`: Foreign key referencing Users

### 3. Bookings
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `user_id`: Foreign key referencing Users
- `property_id`: Foreign key referencing Properties
- `start_date`: Booking start
- `end_date`: Booking end

### 4. Reviews
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `user_id`: Who wrote the review
- `property_id`: Which property it refers to
- `rating`: Score given
- `comment`: Feedback from user

### 5. Payments
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `booking_id`: Related booking
- `amount`: Payment amount
- `status`: Payment status (e.g., success, pending)

**Relationships:**
- A user can book many properties.
- A property can have many bookings and reviews.
- A booking is associated with a user and a property.
- A payment is tied to a booking.

## Feature Breakdown

### 1. User Management
Allows users to register, login, update profiles, and manage their roles (e.g., host or guest). Ensures secure access to protected resources.

### 2. Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings. Properties are enriched with photos, amenities, location, and pricing details.

### 3. Booking System
Enables guests to search, select dates, and book available properties. Manages availability, booking confirmation, and cancellation.

### 4. Review System
Allows guests to rate and provide feedback on their stays, helping others evaluate property quality and host reliability.

### 5. Payment Integration
Securely handles online payments for bookings. Ensures that transactions are validated and that payment status is tracked.

## API Security

### Authentication
Implemented via token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) to verify user identity and control access to protected routes.

### Authorization
Ensures that users can only access and modify resources they own or have permission for (e.g., only hosts can manage their properties).

### Rate Limiting
Prevents abuse by limiting the number of API requests a user can make in a set period of time.

### Why Security Matters
- **User Data Protection**: Ensures personal and financial data is kept confidential.
- **Secure Payments**: Prevents fraud and ensures transaction integrity.
- **System Integrity**: Prevents unauthorized access and maintains platform trust.

## CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) automates the software development lifecycle by automatically testing, building, and deploying code changes.

### Importance
- Detects bugs early via automated tests
- Speeds up delivery of new features
- Ensures consistent environments across stages

### Tools Used
- **GitHub Actions**: For automated workflows (tests, linting, deployment)
- **Docker**: For consistent development and production environments
- **Heroku / AWS / Vercel**: For deploying the application (depending on your stack)
